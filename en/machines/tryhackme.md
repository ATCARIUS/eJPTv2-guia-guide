Below is a list of TryHackMe machines that are ideal for pre-exam preparation. Each machine has been selected for its focus on common services and techniques you will likely encounter on the exam, making them perfect for preparing in realistic environments and improving in the phases of reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation.

**Basic Pentesting**

Difficulty: Easy

Key Services: HTTP, SMB, SSH.

Description: This machine is ideal for those starting in pentesting. It covers the enumeration of SMB and HTTP services, brute-forcing SSH credentials, and the exploitation of common vulnerabilities. You will practice using tools like Nmap, Hydra, and enum4linux, essential for identifying and exploiting insecure configurations in network services.
